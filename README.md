# Installation

After cloning this repo, you must create a .env file in the project root director with this:

ACCESS_TOKEN=Your access token here

You can get your access token by making an account [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/login?to=read_me&redirect=%2Fdocs%2Fgetting-started).
When you make a new account they will give you a API Read Access Token. Use that in your env file.
